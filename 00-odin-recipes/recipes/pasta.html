            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta
                    and cook according to the package instructions until al
                    dente. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water,
                    then drain the pasta and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto sauce. In a
                    food processor or blender, combine the basil leaves,
                    Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, garlic, and lemon juice (if
                    using). Pulse until finely chopped.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the processor running, slowly add the olive oil in a
                    steady stream until the mixture becomes smooth and well
                    combined. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper
                    to taste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl, toss the cooked pasta with the pesto
                    sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the
                    reserved pasta cooking water to thin it out until it reaches
                    your desired consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve the pesto pasta warm, topped with extra grated
                    Parmesan cheese, cherry tomatoes, sautéed vegetables, and
                    basil leaves if desired.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade Pesto Pasta!</li>
