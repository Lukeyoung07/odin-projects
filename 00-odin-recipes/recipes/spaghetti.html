            <p>
                One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles
                together for a dish you can have on the table in less than 45
                minutes. It doesn't get much easier than this by cooking
                everything in one pot. Switch it up by using ground beef,
                chicken, or turkey along with any other of your favorite
                ingredients, such as sliced mushrooms.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine ground sausage, onions, and garlic in a large pot or
                    skillet with tall sides. Cook over medium heat until sausage
                    is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir pasta sauce, water, and Italian seasoning into the pot;
                    bring to a boil. Stir in spaghetti noodles, return to a
                    boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are
                    cooked through and sauce has thickened, 17 to 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Serve topped with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
